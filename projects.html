			<h3>Completed Projects</h3>


			<h4><a href="http://mcfancy.evanamccullough.com">(mc)fancy</a></h4>
			<figure class="projectimg"><a href="http://mcfancy.evanamccullough.com"><img src="images/mcfancy_182x118.jpg" alt="(mc)fancy home page" /></a></figure>
			<p>The (mc)fancy project was to showcase renovations my father did around the house. The site officially launched April 30th, 2013. The first project on the site was of a cabinet that doubles as a fold out table and a murphy bed. The site was coded using a text editor and contains use of CSS, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. The site is also using Google Analytics to track its performance. My father and I are marketing this site to friends and family.</p>


			<h4><a href="iphoneapp.html">iOS application</a></h4>
			<figure class="projectimg"><a href="iphoneapp.html"><img src="images/app-logo.png" alt="icon for app"/></a></figure>
			<p>I successfully created an iOS app using Objective-C and XCode. This app is an iPhone and iPod Touch friendly version of this current site. I am not planning on putting it onto the App Store because I am not currently enrolled in Apple’s developer programs. I am, however, providing the screenshots to show what it looks like and how it behaves.</p>


			<h4><a href="https://github.com/evanmcc92/Emily-Massage-Kit" target="_blank">Massage Counter App<a></h4>
			<figure class="projectimg"><a href="https://github.com/evanmcc92/Emily-Massage-Kit"><img src="images/massage-app-logo.png" alt="icon for massage app"/></a></figure>
			<p>The next iPhone app I created was something for my girlfriend in order to count massages given (I know it’s pretty lame). But this app was more complex that the first app. It required more coding and took a lot longer to develop. Again, I am not enrolled in any developer programs but I have managed to upload the code to GitHub so if you are interested <a href="https://github.com/evanmcc92/Emily-Massage-Kit" target="_blank">feel free to take a look</a>.</p>


			<h4><a href= "http://rails-app-v1.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Rails Blog</a></h4>
			<p>This is the first app I created using Ruby on Rails. I followed along with a tutorial for Ruby beginners and I am very pleased with the outcome. I have been recently working with making the layout to be more dynamic and appealing along with adding more features. The code has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/evanmcc92/rails-app-v1" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and will continue to work on this as time goes on.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://github.com/evanmcc92/Emily-Massage-Kit" target="_blank">JustSayin<a></h4>
			<figure class="projectimg"><a href="http://justsayin.herokuapp.com"><img src="images/justsayin-logo.png" alt="icon for JustSayin"/></a></figure>
			<p>JustSayin is a rails based social media platform I created from September to December of 2013. The app is hosted on Heroku and is running Ruby 2.0.0, Ruby on Rails 4, and PostgreSQL in production. <a href="https://github.com/evanmcc92/JustSayin" target="_blank">Feel free to take a look at the code hosted on my GitHub</a>. I have more details about what the app does and my feelings about it on <a href="http://wp.me/p3Hzyo-1z" target="_blank">my blog here</a>.</p>
